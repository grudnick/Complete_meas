This is a program to measure the spectroscopic completeness in the fields of the wide-field EDisCS data. 

This is not a general code but is rather designed to work with the specific LDP catalog format.

The code is written around a class with methods that:
* measure completeness as a function if color-magnitude space;
* measure completeness in radial bins
* apply completeness weights to the catalog.
